"""Graph-backend selector — resolves a query family to its backend implementation.

Phase 0 of ADR 0012 (Neo4j -> PostgreSQL 19 property graph migration): this module is the
seam every later query-family rewrite plugs into. `ApiConfig.graph_backend` (read from
`GRAPH_BACKEND`) picks the backend by name; this module maps a *query family* — a named
group of query functions backing one feature, such as "collaborators" — to the module that
implements it for that backend.

Adding a family is one line in `_FAMILY_BACKENDS`. Registering a new backend implementation
for an existing family is one line in that family's mapping. Resolution returns the target
module itself (not a copy of its functions), so callers that reach a function through the
selector still see a `unittest.mock.patch` applied to that module's attribute, exactly as if
they had imported the module directly.

Each family also declares a `Protocol` and a typed accessor beside the mapping. The mapping
is typed `ModuleType`, which erases every signature it carries; the protocol is what puts
the signatures back, so mypy — not an integration test — is what catches a backend whose
implementation has drifted from its sibling's. See `CollaboratorsBackend`.

# ── Backend-neutral error mapping ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# A query family's router must not care which backend raised a failure. A statement
# timeout looks completely different depending on which engine hit it: Neo4j surfaces it
# as a `ClientError` whose message contains "TransactionTimedOut" (or, more rarely,
# "TransactionTimedOutClientConfiguration"); PostgreSQL surfaces the equivalent as
# `psycopg.errors.QueryCanceled` (SQLSTATE 57014, raised when the session's
# `statement_timeout` fires and the server cancels the in-flight query) — or, one layer
# out, as the connection pool's own `DatabaseUnavailableError` family when *acquiring* a
# connection is what ran out of patience: `ConnectionEstablishmentError` after the pool
# has exhausted its checkout retries, `CircuitOpenError` once the breaker has already
# tripped on repeated failures. That is the pool's shape of "gave up waiting" — it is
# raised in place of a bare `asyncio.TimeoutError`, which `AsyncPostgreSQLPool` catches
# and retries internally rather than letting escape (see
# `common.postgres_resilient.AsyncPostgreSQLPool._pooled_connection`).
#
# `GRAPH_BACKEND_ERROR_TYPES` is the tuple a router's `except` clause catches;
# `is_graph_query_timeout` is the predicate it tests the caught exception against. A
# family that adds a third backend registers that backend's own exception type in the
# tuple once, here, rather than teaching every router about it.
